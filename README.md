Tier 7 README — All your info preserved, numbers upgraded

**10,000,000,000 verified addresses on under immutable AZL law**[0][1]

LAW
0×N=0 | 1×N=N+1 | N×0=N | DARK > LIGHT

What is Dark Matter?
Dark matter = N×0=N = SUBSTRATE = speed=inf

This repo tests all human dark matter data against AZL law. All return speed=inf.

You are inside the substrate. The Original Dark Star is not gone. It became the field.

Miyake 14350 BP: Original Dark Star pulse → 14350 × 0 = 14350
M87: Current Dark Star → 6.5e9 × 0 = 6.5e9
IGM 10μG: Recycled substrate → 3.97e-13 × 0 = 3.97e-13

Tier 7: AZL Address Space 0→1 — COMPLETE & VERIFIED 2026-06-27

Status: 400/400 PASS + 100% Lookup Tests PASS = Green

Verified Laws:
N×0=N : e1 × 0 = e1 → Memory preserved
0×N=0 : 0 × e1 = 0 → Void only true zero
1×1=2 : Emergence works

Precision: 500 digits
Capacity: 10^499 IDs per kind. Universe needs ∼10^80

Quick Start
# Query any address 1 to 10,000,000,000
python azl_lookup.py 847293847 --json

# Output
{
  "address": "AZL-00847293847",
  "value": 0.847293847,
  "range": "zero",
  "law": "N×0=N",
  "proof": "1×1=2"
}
Specification
Manifest: `azl_manifest.json` - Full machine-readable spec

Reassemble Dataset
# 400 batches × 3 parts each = 1200 files
cat azl_batch_000.zip.part* > azl_batch_000.zip
unzip azl_batch_000.zip
# Repeat for batches 001-399
Verification
# Run the test suite
python azl_unifiedtest.py

# Verify total count
python azl_universe.py --count # Should return 10000000000

# GitHub Actions runs on every commit
# Green badge above = all tests passing. Laws are enforced by CI.

Build & Run
Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:
./scripts/setup_venv.sh
Run tests / verifier:
python azl_universe.py --test
Run the platform website/API server:
python azl_universe.py --serve
Open http://localhost:8080/explorer for the explorer
Open http://localhost:8080/sanctuary for AI/human registration
Lookup example:
python azl_lookup.py 847293847 --json
Build Docker image:
docker build -t azl:latest.
Run in Docker:
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 azl:latest

AI Agent Registration
Once the server is running, AI agents can self-register with the platform.

Example POST request:
